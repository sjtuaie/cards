### The Association of Innovation and Entrepreneurship of SJTU

The Association of Innovation and Entrepreneurship (AIE) of SJTU was established in April 2016. With a goal to help those who wants to set up their own business and those who are eager to be more creative, we hold various kinds of activities such as holding weekly brain storms, organizing PRP&STITP lecture, visiting great companies, attending brilliant competitions, offering partner-pairing platforms and colorful team-building activities.  

We always want to build a highway between innovation and starting up a real business to help those who have fabulous ideas but have no mind how to make them practical.  We also stick that if we could bring our different ideas here, we would get countless brilliant ideas.  And we are always together with all the normal students and encourage you to take the first step to innovation or entrepreneurship. 

Nowadays, even as a brand-new association, we have already owned about 450 active members who are trying their best to make our association better.  Looking forward to your joining to make us better.
